This reduces transaction costs for shippers, as they no longer have to negotiate directly with drivers, and it provides surety of cost, allowing shippers to schedule and price shipments up to two weeks in advance.\r\n\r\nCurrently GoLorry is generating prices manually based on their knowledge of the market.  It is a time-intensive method and is not sustainable as they continue to scale up.  My role was to create an automated pricing mechanism based on their past orders.\r\n\r\n## The Pipeline\r\n\r\nThe pipeline has four main components.  First, a pricing algorithm is created that uses past orders to train a predictive price algorithm for new orders.  Second, the shipper enters a the order details into GoLorry's app.  Next, the algorithm presents the shipper with a price that the customer accepts or rejects.  Finally a cosine similarity measure is used to predict whether the order might be an outlier, i.e. the predicted price is not likely to be accurate.  If the order is similar to another recent order for which the cost was significantly greater than the price, a flag will be raised prompting GoLorry to take a closer look at the order.\r\n\r\n## The Pricing Algorithm\r\n\r\nThe main obstacle with this project was the scarcity of data.  It was not possible to train a useful model using only completed orders with cost details.  As a result, I chose to use the set of all priced orders, whether or not the customer accepted, in order to provide an automated version of the model that GoLorry is currently using.  As their data continues to grow they will be able to update the pricing mechanism using the python code I provided on only completed orders and get a better fit with actual costs.  Once they reach a sufficient level I would suggest transitioning to a more sophisticated machine learning approach to get a more flexible model with more accurate predictions.\r\n\r\nFor the automated pricing model I fit a linear regression to the priced order dataset, and predicted their current pricing with 90% accuracy.  I kept the features limited to avoid overfitting, and to ensure it would translate over into the completed order dataset.\r\n\r\nTwo features of interest that stood out in the regression results were whether the product being shipped was chillies, and whether the shipment was headed to or from West Bengal.  These showed up as significant in the regression, and upon further investigation I found the reasons behind them.\r\n\r\n![Image of workers loading chillies into truck](https://github.com/JenSteele/JenSteele.github.io/blob/master/F2B4EP.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\nChillies are very light, and the trucks are often overloaded in terms of volume.  These overloaded trucks are subject to fines as they cross state borders, but the fine is small enough to make overloading the truck worthwhile.  A shipment of chillies has a surcharge roughly equal to the expected fine.\r\n\r\n![Map of West Bengal](https://github.com/JenSteele/JenSteele.github.io/blob/master/West%20Bengal.png?raw=true)\r\nThe other interesting variable was West Bengal.  There are more shipments that go to West Bengal than shipments leaving West Bengal.  As a result, because drivers' costs are higher if there is no return fare, a shipment with the destination of West Bengal has a premium of 27000 rupees, and a shipment originating in West Bengal will be 17000 rupees cheaper, all else equal.\r\n\r\nThe pricing algorithm had an R-squared of 75% when applied to the completed order data.  This means that the model explains 75% of the variance in the model.  The fitted model slightly overestimates the price, due to the inherent bias in the priced dataset, where on average the prices for orders that were not accepted was slightly higher.  The following graph shows the priced \r\n\r\n Ideally this model would be used only on completed order data in the future, to get a better estimate of the true cost of an order.  However, we should keep in mind that even these data are skewed, as the price was set by GoLorry.  They had a general strategy of taking a fixed margin and as a result the true cost may not have been revealed.",
